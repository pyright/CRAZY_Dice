# CRAZY_Dice
The craziest, fairest, fastest dice roller!



Task 1: Write main function, comments for prototypes, and command line input checks. DONE

Task 2: Write diceCreate() function. Creates an array, dice_array. Length of array represents number of dice faces. An array index represents a single dice face. Content of an element represents the value of a dice face.

Task 3: Write roll() function. Generates a random integer between 0 and sizeof(dice_array)-1. WARNING!!!!! RESEARCH UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION!!!! AVOID RANDOMIZATION WITH LOW UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION. The roll() function uses the generated integer, int dice_face, to access index






Considerations: User interface? Allow user to build a dice with multiple faces of the same value? Good ideas, but let's get the minimum-viable product finished.
