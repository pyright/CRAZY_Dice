# CRAZY_Dice
The craziest, fairest, fastest dice roller!



Task 1: Write main function, comments for prototypes, and command line input checks. DONE

Task 2: Write diceCreate() function. Creates an array, dice_array. Length of array represents number of dice faces. An array index represents a single dice face. Content of an element represents the value of a dice face.

PreRequsite for Task 3: Learn to use uniform_int_distribution

Task 3: Write roll() function. Generates a random integer between 0 and sizeof(dice_array)-1. AVOID RNG WITH LOW UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION. The roll() function uses the generated integer, dice_result, to return dice_array[dice_results];




Important Cnosideration: Develop test code to prove uniform distribution of numbers. Make input a text file of numbers formatted similar to....

    Num1
    Num2
    Num3
    .
    .
    .
    NumZ














Considerations: User interface? Allow user to build a dice with multiple faces of the same value? Good ideas, but let's get the minimum-viable product finished.
